# User-Interface
its a user interface for a MyDairy app using basic html,css and javascript,
I am working on a MyDiary app. It is an online journal where users can pen down their thoughts and feelings. 
However i have to start with the User Interface that is why this repo is named User Interface
It shows the basic features such as: Creation of account and login,add or view entries to the journel,get notifications when are made
